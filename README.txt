This was a class assigned project.

Part one:
Using file solar.txt the program prints the information based on the project instruction
	1. Print without the eighth field 
	2. Print every record without the second field
	3. Print records that have negative orbital periods.
	4. Print only the data with the objects discovered by the Voyager2 space probe
	5. Print each record with the orbital period given in seconds leaving out days.

Part 2:
Using the electricity.txt the program will sort and count based on the project instruction
	1. Alphabetically (non case-sensitive)
	2. Alphabetically with upper case printed before lower case words that have the same initial characters.
	3. The frequency from high to low
	4. The frequency with alphabetical order 

Part 3:
Using dal.txt the program will replace all digits with the name of the digit, so every "0" is replaced with "zero" , "1" is replaced with "one", ... "9" is replaced with "nine".
